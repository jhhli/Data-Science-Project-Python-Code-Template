# Goal
The goal in this respository is to create a working template for any data science project using sklearn

read data
separate X and y
split data into train and test set
numerical transformation (standardization, normalization etc.)
categorical transformation (one-hot-encoding)
build the machine learning model
select the best model
perform hyper-parameter tunning
save the model to local disk

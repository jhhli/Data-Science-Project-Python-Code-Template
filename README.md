# Data Science Project Python Code Template

# Goal
The goal in this respository is to create a working template for any data science project using sklearn

## Read Data
explore various ways of importing data into pandas data frame or numpy n dimensional array

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data

use pandas to check basic data statistics

## Separate X and y

## Split data into train and test set

## Numerical transformation (standardization, normalization etc.)

## Categorical transformation (one-hot-encoding)

## Build the machine learning model: classification models, regression models

## Model evaluation
Introduce various evaluation metrics/socres for different models

## Select the best model


## Perform hyper-parameter tunning
Introduce various hyper-parameter tunning techniques for all kinds of models

## Save the model to local disk
Use pickle or joblib library to save model onto local disk and reload the model later from the saved file
